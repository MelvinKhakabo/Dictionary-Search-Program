Dictionary Search Program 

Overview
This Python project is a dictionary search program that allows users to search for word definitions from a dictionary. The program takes a word input from the user, checks if it exists in the dictionary, and returns its definition. It is capable of handling input in various cases (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case). Additionally, if the user misspells a word, the program uses the difflib library to suggest the closest match.

Features
Load Data from a JSON File: The dictionary data is loaded from a data.json file into a Python dictionary.
Word Definition Lookup: Users can input a word and get its definition from the dictionary.
Case Insensitive Search: The program handles words in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case, treating them all the same.
Misspelled Word Suggestions: If a word is not found, the program suggests the closest word using the difflib library.
Interactive Loop: The program runs in a continuous loop, allowing users to search for words until they type 'exit' to quit.
How It Works
Loading the Dictionary:

The dictionary data is stored in a JSON file named data.json.
The program loads this data into a Python dictionary when the program starts.
Searching for Definitions:

The user enters a word.
The program checks if the word exists in the dictionary, regardless of its case (upper, lower, or mixed).
If the word exists, the program returns the definition.
If the word does not exist, it tries to suggest the closest matching word using the difflib.get_close_matches() function.
Handling Misspelled Words:

When the word is not found, the program uses difflib to find and suggest the closest match to the entered word.
If a close match is found, the program offers the definition of the suggested word.
If no match is found, the program informs the user that no suggestions are available.
Exiting the Program:

The program runs in a loop until the user types "exit," at which point it terminates.
Requirements
Python 3.x
JSON data file (data.json containing dictionary data)
Python libraries: json, difflib (both part of Python standard libraries)
